# Patika.dev-Project-1--Insertion-Sort

#I learned how to sort the elements given as an array. This method is very useful.

Project 1
[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

1)Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type.
-[22,27,16,2,18,6]
-[22,16,27,2,18,6]
-[16,22,27,2,18,6]
-[2,22,27,16,18,6]
-[2,22,16,27,18,6]
-[2,16,22,27,18,6]
-[2,16,22,18,27,6]
-[2,16,18,22,27,6]
-[2,16,18,22,6,27]
-[2,16,18,6,22,27]
-[2,16,6,18,22,27]
-[2,6,16,18,22,27]


2)Write down the Big-O notation.

o(n^2)


3)Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.

[n*(n-1)]/2 : n^2 


4)What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? Write.

-avarage case


Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort.
